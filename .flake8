# E203 whitespace before ':'

# E501 line too long
#   This would be good to have to automatically check string length as Black doesn't do it.
#   However, this includes docstrings and Red's handling of command docstrings
#   sometimes requires long lines to be shown properly in help output.
# E731 do not assign a lambda expression, use a def - while
#   while it's generally a bad practice, we do use these a bit with i18n stuff
# W503 line break before binary operator
#   incompatible with Black
